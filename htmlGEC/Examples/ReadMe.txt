This library module is under development !

The Html library can be used to generate Html code for browsers.

To use it one needs a Server running on the machine.
Make sure that the protection of your machine is prepared for this kind of facility.
The server has to understand php scripts (they normally do).

Try out the examples first and have a look how they are coded.

If you want to make your own application:
Your Clean application has to be compiled with "basic values only" option selected.
Make a copy of any php script, name it foo.php if your executable is called foo.exe.
Edit the script and replace xxx.exe by foo.exe.

Have fun,

Rinus.
